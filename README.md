### Description
## The problem Tour De Cadence solves

Tour de Cadence addresses the lack of engaging and comprehensive learning resources for the Cadence programming language, which is required for creating smart contracts on the Flow blockchain. Existing materials are frequently dry, discouraging newcomers from exploring Flow's potential. Tour de Cadence provides an interactive platform with structured content, quizzes, and dynamic updates to help developers master Cadence and embrace the opportunities of the Flow ecosystem.
